    "**What is the context of the work?**\n",
    "- Since COVID-19 has started spreading in the U.S., our country's economic activity practically stopped - what this means is that corporates in industries such as travel & leisure, hospitality, brick & mortar retail, entertainment, manufacturing, natural resources basically all lost their main sources of revenue. Companies, much like we take on mortgages, take on debt to finance the growth of their businesses - as of 2019, the size of U.S. corporate public debt market passed 9 trillion dollars, and U.S. corporate private debt market more than 1 trillion dollars. Why would people lend this much money to companies? To make investment returns, which is typically represented as the \"yield\" on the debt investments. How do companies pay these debt back? Through generating cash flows Unfortunately right now, the companies mentioned in the above industries are not generating revenue, hence no cash flow. As you might have started to realize, the value of debt investments are highly dependent on the likelihood of companies repaying their debt, and during economic contractions and inactivity, the price tags on these debt investments fall, leading the yield on the debt investments to rise. \n",
